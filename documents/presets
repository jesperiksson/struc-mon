In the 'preset' folder there are python modules containing the code that defines neural nets. These modules (files) are structured such that they contain a number of classes which define the neural net and the shape of the data. These classes are imported by the `NeuralNet` objects, hence it is important that their attributes have their specific names. The `Settings_nn` class defines the input and output shapes and the activation funciton. The `Settings_train`, `Settings_eval` and `Settings_test` each specify the parameters for each process. The `DataSplit` class defines the the fractions which the data is split into. `train : float = 0.6` means that 60% of the available data will be designated as training data for example. These three attributes must sum to 1.0.
